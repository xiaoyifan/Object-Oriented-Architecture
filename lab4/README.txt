The architecture is pretty clear. In the code, I divided the whole system into 5 files. 

That is hardware, controller, recipes, UI, and the main running file, which 
represent the MVC pattern and implemented the Strategy pattern in recipe interface.

For each strategy, I hardcode the time of running. So the test could be simpler.
